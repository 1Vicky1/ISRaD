## What is ISRaD?
ISRaD is a open community repository for soil radiocarbon data.  
Our goals are:
* To improve the use of radiocarbon as a constraint for understanding the soil carbon cycle
* To provide a place for researchers to contribute their soil radiocarbon data once their paper is published
* To produce tools to make the repository useful 

ISRaD has been developed as a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey Powell Center and the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry.

## Publications
ISRaD builds on data summarized by two publication.  It fixes a number of issues and adds new data.

Mathieu, J. A., Hatté, C., Balesdent, J., & Parent, É. (2015). Deep soil carbon dynamics are driven more by soil type than by climate: a worldwide meta-analysis of radiocarbon profiles. Global Change Biology, 21(11), 4278–4292. <a href="http://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13012">http://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13012</a>

He, Y., Trumbore, S. E., Torn, M. S., Harden, J. W., Vaughn, L. J. S., Allison, S. D., & Randerson, J. T. Radiocarbon constraints imply reduced carbon uptake by soils during the 21st century. Science, 355(6306), 1419–1424. <a href="http://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad4273">http://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad4273</a>
